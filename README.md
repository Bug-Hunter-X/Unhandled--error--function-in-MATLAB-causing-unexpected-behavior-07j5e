# Unhandled 'error' function in MATLAB
This example demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB that arises from the improper use of the 'error' function within custom functions. When an 'error' is thrown within a function, it halts execution immediately, and no further code in the function will run. The example also shows a solution using try-catch block.
